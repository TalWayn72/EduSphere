# Files excluded from Prettier formatting

# This workflow YAML uses a multi-line run block with embedded shell commit
# message that contains bare colons (SOC2 CC3.3: ...) at column 0 inside the
# YAML block scalar, which trips Prettier's YAML parser ("All collection items
# must start at the same column").  The file is valid YAML and valid for
# GitHub Actions; exclude from Prettier to avoid a false-positive parse error.
