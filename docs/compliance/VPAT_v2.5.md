| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1.1.1 Non-text Content** (Level A)                                     | Supports                 | All images have descriptive `alt` attributes. Decorative images use `alt=""`. Video thumbnails carry descriptive alt text. Icon-only buttons use `aria-label`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **1.2.1 Audio-only and Video-only (Prerecorded)** (Level A)              | Not Applicable           | EduSphere does not publish audio-only or video-only prerecorded content without accompanying transcript or visual track.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **1.2.2 Captions (Prerecorded)** (Level A)                               | Supports                 | The video player loads WebVTT caption tracks via the `<track kind="subtitles">` element. Captions are available for all prerecorded course video content. The caption toggle button is keyboard-accessible with visible focus.                                                                                                       |
| **1.2.3 Audio Description or Media Alternative (Prerecorded)** (Level A) | Supports with Exceptions | Instructors are required by the course-creation workflow to upload a transcript or audio-description track. Enforcement is advisory; existing legacy content may lack descriptions until re-uploaded.                                                                                                                                |
| **1.3.1 Info and Relationships** (Level A)                               | Supports                 | Semantic HTML5 landmarks (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<aside>`) are used throughout. Heading hierarchy (`h1`–`h6`) is enforced by the TipTap rich-text editor. Tables use `<th scope>` and `<caption>`. Form fields are associated with `<label for>` or `aria-labelledby`.                                          |
| **1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence** (Level A)                                  | Supports                 | DOM order reflects visual reading order. CSS `order` and absolute positioning are not used in ways that create sequence mismatches. RTL Hebrew layout is implemented via CSS `direction: rtl` rather than DOM reordering.                                                                                                            |
| **1.3.3 Sensory Characteristics** (Level A)                              | Supports                 | Instructions do not rely solely on shape, color, size, or spatial position. Error states use text labels in addition to red color.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **1.4.1 Use of Color** (Level A)                                         | Supports                 | Color is never the sole means of conveying information. Error states include icon + text + color. Required fields use an asterisk label in addition to a color cue. Chart data uses both color and pattern/label.                                                                                                                    |
| **1.4.2 Audio Control** (Level A)                                        | Supports                 | No audio plays automatically. The video player requires explicit user action to start playback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **2.1.1 Keyboard** (Level A)                                             | Supports                 | All interactive elements are reachable via Tab and operable with Enter/Space. The knowledge graph visualization provides keyboard navigation via arrow keys. Custom dropdown and modal components use Radix UI primitives, which implement the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide patterns.                                              |
| **2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap** (Level A)                                     | Supports                 | Modal dialogs use Radix UI `Dialog` which manages focus trapping and releases focus on close. No keyboard traps exist outside of intentional modal focus management (which is dismissible with Escape).                                                                                                                              |
| **2.1.4 Character Key Shortcuts** (Level A)                              | Not Applicable           | EduSphere does not implement single-character key shortcuts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **2.2.1 Timing Adjustable** (Level A)                                    | Not Applicable           | No time limits are imposed on user interactions. Session timeout is handled by Keycloak and provides a re-authentication dialog rather than a hard cutoff.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **2.2.2 Pause, Stop, Hide** (Level A)                                    | Supports                 | Auto-updating content (live session participant list, notification badges) can be paused. No content moves, blinks, or scrolls automatically without user initiation.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **2.3.1 Three Flashes or Below Threshold** (Level A)                     | Supports                 | No content flashes more than three times per second. Video content is the responsibility of the content creator; the platform embeds WCAG flash-guidance in course-creation instructions.                                                                                                                                            |
| **2.4.1 Bypass Blocks** (Level A)                                        | Supports                 | A "Skip to main content" skip-navigation link is the first focusable element on every page. It is visible on focus and moves focus directly to `<main>`.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **2.4.2 Page Titled** (Level A)                                          | Supports                 | Each page has a unique `<title>` constructed as `"Page Name – EduSphere"`. React Router updates the document title on every navigation event.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **2.4.3 Focus Order** (Level A)                                          | Supports                 | Tab order follows DOM order, which matches visual layout. Modal dialogs shift focus to the dialog heading on open and restore focus to the trigger element on close.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context)** (Level A)                            | Supports                 | All links have descriptive text. Icon-only action links carry `aria-label`. "Read more" links are supplemented with `aria-describedby` referencing the content title.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **2.5.1 Pointer Gestures** (Level A)                                     | Supports                 | No multipoint or path-based gestures are required. All pointer operations use single-tap/click.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **2.5.2 Pointer Cancellation** (Level A)                                 | Supports                 | Destructive actions (delete, remove) trigger confirmation dialogs activated on `mouseup`/`pointerup`, allowing cancellation by moving off the control.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **2.5.3 Label in Name** (Level A)                                        | Supports                 | Visible button and link labels are included in the accessible name. Icon-button `aria-label` values match the visible tooltip text.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **2.5.4 Motion Actuation** (Level A)                                     | Not Applicable           | No functionality is triggered by device motion or user motion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **3.1.1 Language of Page** (Level A)                                     | Supports                 | The `<html lang>` attribute is set dynamically based on the user's language preference. Hebrew UI sets `lang="he"` and `dir="rtl"`. English UI sets `lang="en"`. Supported locales: `en`, `he`.                                                                                                                                      |
| **3.2.1 On Focus** (Level A)                                             | Supports                 | No context changes occur on focus. Dropdowns reveal options on activation (Enter/Space), not on focus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **3.2.2 On Input** (Level A)                                             | Supports                 | Form submission requires explicit action. No context changes occur on input. Dynamic filtering in search fields only updates results, not navigation.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **3.3.1 Error Identification** (Level A)                                 | Supports                 | Form validation errors are identified with `aria-describedby` linking the field to its error message. Error messages describe the field name and the nature of the error (e.g., "Email is required"). React Hook Form + Zod resolvers provide consistent error messaging.                                                            |
| **3.3.2 Labels or Instructions** (Level A)                               | Supports                 | All form fields have visible labels. Input format requirements are provided as placeholder text and/or helper text beneath the field. Password requirements are listed before the password field.                                                                                                                                    |
| **4.1.1 Parsing** (Level A)                                              | Supports                 | React renders well-formed HTML. Unique `id` attributes are enforced via component conventions. No duplicate IDs are generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **4.1.2 Name, Role, Value** (Level A)                                    | Supports                 | Custom interactive components built on Radix UI primitives expose correct ARIA roles, states, and properties. Custom compound components (QuizPlayer, ScenarioPlayer, VideoPlayer) use explicit `role`, `aria-*`, and `tabindex` attributes. State changes (expanded/collapsed, checked/unchecked) are reflected in ARIA attributes. |

| Criteria                                                            | Conformance Level        | Remarks and Explanations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1.2.4 Captions (Live)** (Level AA)                                | Supports with Exceptions | Live BigBlueButton sessions support live captions when the host enables the built-in caption feature. Automatic captions are not provided by the platform; they depend on the BBB server configuration. Hosts are advised to enable captions for accessible sessions.                                                           |
| **1.2.5 Audio Description (Prerecorded)** (Level AA)                | Supports with Exceptions | Audio descriptions for prerecorded video can be uploaded as a separate audio-described version. The video player supports multiple source tracks. Upload of audio-described versions is not yet mandated by the workflow; it is a course-creation recommendation.                                                               |
| **1.3.4 Orientation** (Level AA)                                    | Supports                 | The UI is fully functional in both portrait and landscape orientations. No content or functionality is restricted to a single orientation. The Expo mobile app adapts to device orientation via `useWindowDimensions`.                                                                                                          |
| **1.3.5 Identify Input Purpose** (Level AA)                         | Supports                 | Common personal data fields (name, email, preferred language) include `autocomplete` attributes (`name`, `email`, `language`). Profile form fields use HTML `autocomplete` to enable autofill.                                                                                                                                  |
| **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum)** (Level AA)                             | Supports                 | All text meets a minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio against its background. Large text (≥18pt normal or ≥14pt bold) meets 3:1. UI component boundaries meet 3:1. Contrast ratios were verified with the Colour Contrast Analyser and automated via axe-core in `accessibility.spec.ts`. Brand blue (#2563EB) on white achieves 5.9:1. |
| **1.4.4 Resize Text** (Level AA)                                    | Supports                 | Text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality. The layout is fluid (Tailwind CSS flex/grid). No fixed-pixel font sizes that prevent browser zoom.                                                                                                                                                     |
| **1.4.5 Images of Text** (Level AA)                                 | Supports                 | Text is rendered as live text. No images of text are used except for logos (which are exempt). Course thumbnail images may contain decorative text; they carry alt text describing the course.                                                                                                                                  |
| **1.4.10 Reflow** (Level AA)                                        | Supports                 | Content reflows at 320 CSS pixels width without horizontal scrolling and without loss of information. Tailwind responsive breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`) provide fluid layout adaptation. Data tables on narrow viewports scroll horizontally with `overflow-x: auto` on a wrapper, preserving data access.                     |
| **1.4.11 Non-text Contrast** (Level AA)                             | Supports                 | UI component boundaries (buttons, inputs, checkboxes) have at least 3:1 contrast against adjacent colors. Focus indicators have at least 3:1 contrast. Verified via axe-core.                                                                                                                                                   |
| **1.4.12 Text Spacing** (Level AA)                                  | Supports                 | No loss of content or functionality occurs when line height is set to 1.5× font size, letter spacing to 0.12× font size, word spacing to 0.16× font size, and paragraph spacing to 2× font size. Tested with the Text Spacing bookmarklet.                                                                                      |
| **1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus** (Level AA)                     | Supports                 | Tooltip content triggered by hover/focus is dismissible (Escape), hoverable (pointer can move over the tooltip), and persistent (does not disappear until dismissed or focus moves away). Radix UI `Tooltip` component is used consistently.                                                                                    |
| **2.4.5 Multiple Ways** (Level AA)                                  | Supports                 | Users can reach every page via the primary navigation, a site-wide search (`/search`), or direct URL. Course catalog is browsable and filterable.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **2.4.6 Headings and Labels** (Level AA)                            | Supports                 | All headings describe their section. Form labels describe their inputs. Section headings are not decorative.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **2.4.7 Focus Visible** (Level AA)                                  | Supports                 | A visible focus indicator is present on all interactive elements when using keyboard navigation. The CSS rule `*:focus-visible { outline: 2px solid #2563EB; outline-offset: 2px }` applies globally via the Tailwind base layer. The `focus-visible` pseudo-class ensures indicators appear for keyboard users only.           |
| **2.5.8 Target Size (Minimum)** (Level AA — WCAG 2.2)               | Supports                 | All interactive targets have a minimum activation area of 24×24 CSS pixels. A global CSS floor rule in `globals.css` enforces `min-height: 24px; min-width: 24px` on interactive elements. Inline text links and user-agent controls are exempt per SC 2.5.8 Exception 2.                                                       |
| **3.1.2 Language of Parts** (Level AA)                              | Supports                 | Content in a language other than the page language uses `lang` attribute on the containing element (e.g., `<blockquote lang="he">` for Hebrew quotations within English pages). The TipTap editor preserves `lang` attributes on pasted content.                                                                                |
| **3.2.3 Consistent Navigation** (Level AA)                          | Supports                 | The primary navigation (`<nav>`) appears in the same position and order on every authenticated page. The Layout component wraps all authenticated routes.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **3.2.4 Consistent Identification** (Level AA)                      | Supports                 | Components with the same function are identified consistently. The "Skip to main content" link, search field, and primary action buttons use the same labels and icons throughout the application.                                                                                                                              |
| **3.3.3 Error Suggestion** (Level AA)                               | Supports                 | Where validation error type is known, the error message provides a suggestion (e.g., "Enter a valid email address such as name@example.com"). Zod error messages are customized to be prescriptive.                                                                                                                             |
| **3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal, Financial, Data)** (Level AA)      | Supports                 | Destructive operations (delete course, revoke enrollment) present a confirmation dialog. The quiz submission step shows a summary and asks for confirmation. Form data is preserved on back-navigation.                                                                                                                         |
| **4.1.3 Status Messages** (Level AA)                                | Supports                 | Success and error notifications are implemented as toast messages with `role="status"` or `role="alert"`. They are announced by screen readers without requiring focus. NATS-pushed live notifications also use `role="status"` in the notification panel.                                                                      |
| **2.4.11 Focus Appearance (Minimum)** (Level AA — WCAG 2.2)         | Supports                 | The focus indicator for keyboard focus is a 2px solid #2563EB outline with 2px offset. It achieves ≥3:1 contrast against both the white and light-grey page backgrounds. Implemented globally in `globals.css`. Automated test in `accessibility.spec.ts`.                                                                      |
| **2.4.12 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum)** (Level AA — WCAG 2.2)       | Supports                 | The focused element is never fully hidden by sticky headers or overlays. `scroll-padding-top` on `<html>` accounts for the header height. Confirmed via automated and manual keyboard-navigation tests.                                                                                                                         |
| **3.3.8 Accessible Authentication (Minimum)** (Level AA — WCAG 2.2) | Supports                 | No CAPTCHA is required for authentication. Keycloak Browser Flow does not include any cognitive-function-test authenticator. Brute-force protection uses time-delay lockout, which is permitted by SC 3.3.8.                                                                                                                    |
